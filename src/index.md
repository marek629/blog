# Blog

Hello, my Unknown Reader!

## About me

My name is Marek JÄ™dryka.
I'm a programmer since 2013 based in Poland.
I used to write in several languages, but my workload in JavaScript was increasing since 2015.

## My motivation

I decided to start writing a blog because I need to improve my English skills.

I feel I need to rebalance my English output and input skills.
My input skills are much better than my output skills.
As input skills, I mean reading and listening.
And of course, output skills are writing and speaking for me.

So let me practice my writing skills.
I will write about the JavaScript ecosystem.
I suppose that I will focus on node.js.
We'll see what comes of that.

## What are you doing here?

I don't know.
Anyway, enjoy here or anywhere else!
