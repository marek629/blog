# Blog

Hello my Unknown Reader!

## About me

My name is Marek JÄ™dryka.
I'm a programmer since 2013 based in Poland.
I used to written in several languages, but my workload in JavaScript was incrising since 2015.

## My motivation

I decided to start write a blog, because I need improve my English skills.

I feel I need rebalance my English output and input skills.
My input skills are much better than my output skills.
As input skills I mean reading and listening.
And of course output skills are writing and speaking for me.

So let me practice my writting skills.
I will write about JavaScript ecosystem.
I suppose that I will focus on node.js.
We'll see what would be returned.

## What are you doing here?

I don't know.
Anyway enjoy here or anywhere else!
